                My name is Shuaa, I am 16 years old and currently in grade ten. I am taking computer science as one of my optional courses, and throughout this semester I have learned a lot about programming and problem solving. I enjoy working with code because it allows me to be creative while also thinking logically. This e-portfolio highlights the skills and projects I have worked on so far.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of computer science, I enjoy learning new things and pushing myself to improve. I am excited to continue building my skills and exploring more areas of computer science in the future.

            <h2>Future Computer Science Careers</h2>
            <p>
                Although I am not completely certain about pursuing a career strictly in computer science, there are several computer science–related jobs that interest me. Some possible careers include web developer, software developer, game designer, or IT support specialist. These careers involve creativity, problem solving, and working with technology, which are aspects of computer science that I enjoy.
            </p>
            <p>
                To work towards these potential careers, I plan to continue taking computer science courses throughout high school to strengthen my understanding of programming concepts. I also want to practice coding independently, work on small projects, and learn more about different programming languages. These steps will help me build useful skills that I can apply to computer science careers or other technology-related fields in the future.

            <h2>My Sample Work</h2>
            <p>
                Below are three projects that I am most proud of from this semester. These assignments helped me understand both the theory behind computer science and how to apply programming concepts in code.
            </p>

            <h3>Project 1: Computer Architecture Slideshow</h3>
            <p>
                This project was a multi-part slideshow assignment focused on computer architecture. It was divided into three sections: microprocessors (Part A), digital and analog devices (Part B), and modern memory and mass storage devices (Part C). The purpose of this assignment was to show my understanding of how computers are structured and how different hardware components work together.
            </p>

            <h3>Project 2: Integer Calculation Program</h3>
            <p>
                This programming assignment uses Python to ask the user for three integer numbers. The program multiplies the three numbers together, finds their total, and then subtracts the total from the product. The final result is printed in a sentence that includes the numbers entered by the user and the calculated answer. This assignment helped me practice working with user input, variables, and mathematical operations.
            </p>

            <h3>Project 3: List, Loop, and Average Program</h3>
            <p>
                In this Python assignment, the program uses a loop to ask the user for five numbers and stores them in a list. A for loop is then used to calculate the total of the numbers, followed by calculating the average. The program prints both the total and the average in a clear sentence format. This project helped me better understand lists, loops, and how to work with numerical data.
